# 📊 Power BI Dashboard – Sales & Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a two-page interactive **Power BI dashboard portfolio project** built using a real-world e-commerce dataset.

The objective is to analyze **sales performance, revenue trends, category contribution, and top-performing products** using Power BI and DAX.

The dashboard is designed with a clean and business-focused layout suitable for **Business Intelligence and Data Analyst roles.**

**Dataset period:**  
September 2016 – October 2018


## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Monitor overall revenue performance  
- Track total orders and average order value  
- Analyze monthly revenue trends  
- Identify top revenue-generating categories  
- Evaluate top-performing products  
- Understand revenue distribution across segments  


## 🗂 Dataset Description

**Source:** Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist (Kaggle)

The dataset was previously modeled and analyzed using SQL.  
For this project, structured outputs were used to build a business-ready Power BI dashboard.

Main analytical datasets:

- `monthly_revenue`
- `category_revenue`
- `top_products`

Only **delivered orders** were included to reflect completed sales performance.


## 🧱 Data Model & Design

The data model follows a **clean and simplified analytical structure** optimized for dashboard performance.

Custom DAX measures were created for:

```DAX
Total Revenue
Total Orders
Average Order Value
Revenue Share %
Ranking Measures

Top N filtering and ranking logic were implemented for category and product analysis.
